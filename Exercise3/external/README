This is the folder for the source codes of external libraries, in particular boost and eigen.

For boost, extract the 'boost' subfolder of the boost source code archive into this folder. Afterwards, you should be able to access the folder external/boost/graph, where external is the folder where this README file is located.

For eigen, extract the source code into this folder, and rename the extracte folder as 'eigen'. You should find the file external/eigen/Eigen/Dense afterwards.
